# Do it #1

Download and unzip Dumas to the Desktop.  
Open terminal and go to the desktop. 
Find the Dumas directory. 

What does the -m switch do?  
What does the -b switch do? 
How much space do all the files in the directory take up? 

---
# Do it #2

Within the Dumas directory, organize the files. Rename the prologue and epilogue files so that they sort correctly. 

Open a text file, make a change, and save using the same filename.

Create a new file named notes.txt, enter some text, and save.
---
# Do it #3

Search all the text files for a keyword (king, prince, duke, princess, duchess are all good) and output the results to a text file.  Do the same again, but with line numbers. 

Generate a list of the word counts of all the text files. Extra credit: sort and export the list to a text file.
